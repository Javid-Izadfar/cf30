        and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs, winning several titles.
        Real Madrid and Barcelona dominated the championship in the 1950s, each
        winning four La Liga titles during the decade. During the 1960s and
        1970s, Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning fourteen titles, with
        Atlético Madrid winning four.[4] During the 1980s and 1990s Real Madrid
        were prominent in La Liga, but the Basque clubs of Athletic Bilbao and
        Real Sociedad had their share of success, each winning two Liga titles.
        From the 1990s onward, Barcelona has dominated La Liga, winning
        seventeen titles to date.[5] Although Real Madrid has also been
        prominent, winning eleven titles, La Liga has also seen other champions,
        including Valencia and Deportivo La Coruña.

        According to UEFA's league coefficient rankings, La Liga was the top
        league in Europe in each of the seven years from 2013 to 2019
        (calculated using accumulated figures from five preceding seasons) and
        led Europe for 22 of the 60 ranked years up to 2019, more than any other
        country. It also has produced the continent's top-rated club more times
        (22) than any other league in that period, more than double that of
        second-placed Serie A (Italy), including the top club in 10 of the 11
        seasons between 2009 and 2019; each of these pinnacles was achieved by
        either Barcelona or Real Madrid. La Liga clubs have won the most UEFA
        Champions League (20), UEFA Europa League (14), UEFA Super Cup (16) and
        FIFA Club World Cup (8) titles, and its players have accumulated the
        highest number of Ballon d'Or awards (24), The Best FIFA Men's Player
        awards (19)[e] and UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards (12).
